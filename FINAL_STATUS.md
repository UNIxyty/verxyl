# 🎉 Ticket System - Final Status

## ✅ **All Operations Working Successfully**

### **🔧 What Was Fixed:**

#### **1. Webhook Functionality:**
- ✅ **Webhooks working** for all ticket actions (created, updated, solved, deleted, in_work)
- ✅ **Environment variable** `WEBHOOK_URL` properly configured in Vercel
- ✅ **Ticket title** included in all webhook parameters
- ✅ **New action** `in_work` added for when workers start work

#### **2. Database Operations:**
- ✅ **Delete tickets** - Working perfectly
- ✅ **Edit tickets** - Working perfectly  
- ✅ **Complete tickets** - Working perfectly
- ✅ **Create tickets** - Working perfectly

#### **3. API Routes:**
- ✅ **Service role client** properly configured for server-side operations
- ✅ **RLS policies** set up to allow service role operations
- ✅ **Error handling** and logging implemented
- ✅ **Environment variables** all properly configured

### **🛡️ Security Status:**

#### **Current Setup:**
- ✅ **Row Level Security (RLS)** enabled on tickets table
- ✅ **Permissive policies** allow all operations (temporary for functionality)
- ✅ **Service role** properly bypasses RLS for API operations
- ✅ **Environment variables** secured in Vercel

#### **Future Security Enhancement:**
The current setup uses permissive policies (`WITH CHECK (true)` and `USING (true)`) for maximum functionality. When ready, these can be replaced with proper user-based policies for enhanced security.

### **📋 Working Features:**

#### **Ticket Management:**
- ✅ Create tickets with urgency, deadline, and assignment
- ✅ Edit tickets (one-time only restriction)
- ✅ Delete tickets (creator only)
- ✅ Complete tickets with solution data
- ✅ Start work on tickets (in_progress status)

#### **Webhook Notifications:**
- ✅ `created` - When new tickets are created
- ✅ `updated` - When tickets are edited
- ✅ `in_work` - When workers start work on tickets
- ✅ `solved` - When tickets are completed

#### **User Interface:**
